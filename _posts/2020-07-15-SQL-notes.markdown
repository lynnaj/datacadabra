This is a cheatsheet for SQL!

General format of SQL:
SELECT col1, col2, COUNT(col3) AS cnt_col3
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2
ON t1.col2 = t2.col1
GROUP BY col1, col2
HAVING COUNT(col3) > 10

WINDOW FUNCTION:
SELECT * 
FROM(
	SELECT user_id, inv_id, paid_id,
	RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY paid_at ASC) AS order_number
	FROM table.orders) AS subquery
WHERE order_number = 1)

Example of another window function:
SUM() OVER (PARTIION BY ----- ORDER BY -----) AS running_total

CASE WHEN for creating "buckets":
SELECT COUNT(ID) AS COUNT,
	(CASE WHEN stars BETWEEN 0 and 0.9 THEN '0'
			WHEN stars BETWEEN 1 and 1.9 THEN '1-2'
			ELSE 'other'
			END) AS star_rating
FROM business
WHERE city = 'Avon'
GROUP BY star_rating
ORDER BY star_rating

MULTIJOIN on Attribute Table:
SELECT O.orderID, S.attrValue as State, C.attrValue as City
FROM order O, attr S, attr C
WHERE O.orderID = S.orderID
AND O.orderID = C.orderID
AND S.attrName = 'State'
AND C.attrName = 'City'

An example where I've dealt with NULLS:
To view nulls: SELECT * FROM table WHERE name is NULL
To replace nulls with zeros: SELECT COALESCE(table.business_count, 0) AS business_count FROM table

Deleting duplicates:
Create ROW_ID to distinguish the rows
DELETE FROM YourTable
WHERE rowid not in (
	SELECT MIN(rowid) 
	FROM YourTable 
	GROUP BY hash, d)

Example of using variable within a query, availble with MS SQL:
DECLARE @name as VARCHAR(10)
SET name = 'name'
SELECT * from table WHERE name=@name


Ways subqueries can be used:
1) as a filter
SELECT cust_ID, cust_name, region
FROM customer
WHERE cust_ID in (	SELECT cust_ID
					FROM orders
					WHERE total_inv > 1000)

2) as a calculation
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary,
			(SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary), 0)
			FROM employees) average_salary,
    		salary - (	SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary), 0)
    					FROM employees) difference
FROM employees
ORDER BY first_name , last_name


3) to aggregate in multiple stages
SELECT LEFT(sub.date, 2) AS cleaned_month,
       sub.day_of_week,
       AVG(sub.incidents) AS average_incidents
FROM (
        SELECT day_of_week,
               date,
               COUNT(incidnt_num) AS incidents
          FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
         GROUP BY 1,2
       ) sub
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
