I found this great resource for publishing ipython notebooks on jekyll:
https://cduvallet.github.io/posts/2018/03/ipython-notebooks-jekyll

And this is just my simple test.  I used a local ipython notebook to do a simple addition and then I'm publishing the notebook per the blog's instructions:

```python
x = 5
```

# This is just a test python notebook


```python
y = 10
```


```python
x + y
```




    15




```python

```
